# ✨ Hi, I'm Frangu Mădălin


I'm a 22 years old, self-taught, software developer.
With every line of code I write I get closer to my dream, to become a software enginner.

📖 Currently I'm learning and working at the same time, doing freelance work (mainly Static Websites).    
  
My website => https://frann.dev
  
🕘 At the moment I'm spending my time learning different frameworks (React, Spring, Django)
